fast computation / high memory use 


branch lengths ~ iid gamma of mean mu and variance epsilon*mu^2
mu ~ exponential of mean 0.1
epsilon ~ exponential of mean 1

CAT model
   Dirichlet process of equilibrium frequency profiles
   flexible prior on profiles:
   profile ~ iid from a Dirichlet of center pi0 and concentration delta
   pi0 ~ uniform
   delta ~ exponential of mean Nstate (=20 on amino-acid data, 4 on nucleotide data)

relative exchange rates:
gtr (relative rates ~ iid from an exponential of mean 1)

rates ~ gamma of mean 1 and variance 1/alpha
4 discrete categories (Yang 1994)
alpha ~ exponential of mean 1
